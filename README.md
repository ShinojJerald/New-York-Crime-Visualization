# New-York-Crime-Visualization
Crimes  are  fundamental  social  issues  influencing personal satisfaction, financial development, and notoriety of a nation. Violations are one of the central points to influence essential  choices  in  a  person's  life,  like  moving  homes, avoiding dangerous  neighborhoods,  not  going out  at night. Violations  influence  and  shape  the  picture  of  a  network. Similarly,  crimes  influence  the  economy  of  a  country  by putting fiscal  weight on  government, requiring extra  police officers,  courts,  and  administration.    Reducing  crime  has become  challenging  due  to  the  rate  at  which  they  occur.

In this project, I am analysing the increasing crime rates in New York city and exploring the reasons behind it is the main inspiration.
Performed analysis on large variety of dataset to investigate what factors are driving people to commit crimes & relationships that influence these cities to have a greater disposition to crime. Performed data pre-processing using scaled population column to ratio, correlation calculation, logistic Regression & used various regression models in R.
